                    <h1>"Grade Inflation" May Be Less Prevalent At MU Than Many SEC schools</h1>

                    <h3> MU GPA has increased 0.20 points since 1997, according to the registrar. Yet many other SEC schools, like Alabama (0.49), have increased more in the same period of time. MU's GPA increase fits the trend of 0.1 point per decade that one researcher found. Stuart Rojstaczer, a geophysicist and writer, said, "It's a good guess that the trend hasn't changed much over the last two to three years.  There's no reason it would have changed."

                        In the early 1980s, colleges began to use student coarse evaluations. And that's one reason why grades have gone up, according to research by Rojstaczer. He is a former Duke University science professor. Rojstaczer said students then became consumers of education, rather than participants, who should be satisfied by their results.
